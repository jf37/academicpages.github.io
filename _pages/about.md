Iâ€™m a designer from Miami, FL interested in the interaction between structures, architecture, art, and sustainable design. My background in architecture, civil engineering, mathematics, fine arts, and sustainability allows me to bring a distinctive and yet relevant perspective to research within the field of structural engineering. Pursuing a Ph.D. in Civil Engineering at Princeton University and working with Prof. Adriaenssens and members of the Form Finding Lab allows me to explore my interests more holistically.
